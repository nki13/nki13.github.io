            <h3>Introduction...</h3>

                

            <p>Every Strength Athlete has gone to the drawing board and re-evaluated what they need to improve on. In almost 

            all these cases the athlete could achieve a successful offseason with a block of training becoming more explosive,

                

            and fulfilling strength potentials. This 4 week program has three different phases with different focuses 

                

            (Hypertrophy, Strength, Power). This linear progression and overload is a simple training periodization that has

                

            been used by the strength coaches all around the world. Although you may not be looking to be the strongest 

                

            athlete in the world, everyone can benefit from becoming a stronger version of themselves. The name of the

                

            program “Strength Inquiry” mentions that this en-tire program is made off of inquiries I have made as a training

                

            athlete. I have compiled every effective concept of training and made a program that appeals to the strength 

                

            athlete looking to get serious about being better and bigger.</p>

                

            <br>

                

            <br>

                

                        

                

            <h3>Weekly Training Split</h3>

                

            <p>Keys to Frequency:<br>

                

                One of the biggest factors for any natural strength athlete is practicing his/her craft. This can be achieved 

                

                by lowering a workout’s volume and increasing the weekly frequency. The benefits of this logic is great for 

                

                achieving hypertrophy and promoting recovery.
