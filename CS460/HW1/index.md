# Homework 1

Go back to [Home Page](https://nki13.github.io)
* For this homework I had to write a multi-page, hyperlinked set of web pages using HTML, and styling them with CSS and Bootstrap. I was decently familiar with HTML, but spent alot of time googling about CSS and Boostrap. What was really unfamiliar to me was GIt. Once I could wrap my head around it, I ended up benefitting alot from what is has to offer.

## Step 1: Setup Git, create a GitHub account, create local and remote repositories, then synchronize them.

Once Git was downloaded from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads), I created a local repository to hold all homeworks to come, then initialized it as a git folder. Once that was setup, I did a git config. Once I created an account on GitHub and made a new remote repository to synchronize with my local one, using git remote add as shown below. Then I did a quick git remote to makesure it was added.

```bash
cd Desktop
mkdir Git
cd Git
git init
git config --global user.name "nki13"
git config --global user.email "nki13@wou.edu"
git remote add origin https://github.com/nki13/nki13.github.io
git remote
```
## Step 2: Setup HTML and css
