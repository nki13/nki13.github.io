# Journal - Homework 4 New

For this homework, I created my first ASP.NET MVC 5 Web application that does not use a database. This web application has two features, which include a mile to metric converter and a color mixer. Through this homework, I learn how to send data from the browser to the server and vice versa. Also, I was required to use two git branches for this homework for each feature, to get familiar with merging conflicts.
I was unfamiliar with MVC projects and Razor code. Thankfully, in class, we did some examples and were able to get a gist of where in the MVC project we would be making changes to, or adding to. With that, I decided to dive in.

## Step 1: Setting up

Getting set up for this fairly simple thanks to Visual Studio. I created my ASP.NET MVC 5 Project with no problems and felt like I was off to a good start. Before committing my setup project to master, I added to my .gitignore file to include the ignored files for this homework. Then I decided to create one of my branches for this homework from here. I decided to name this branch 4converter.

## Step 2: Tackling the Index.cshtml page


## Step 3: Mile to Metric Converter

## Step 4: Color Mixer

## Step 5: Merging and Commenting

## Results: Working!
